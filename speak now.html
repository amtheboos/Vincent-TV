The way you move is like a full on rainstorm<br/>
And I'm a house of cards<br/>
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running<br/>
But I kinda know that I won't get far<br/><br/>

And you stood there in front of me just<br/>
Close enough to touch<br/>
Close enough to hope you couldn't see<br/>
What I was thinking of<br/><br/>

Drop everything now<br/>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br/>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br/>
Take away the pain<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly, whenever you smile<br/>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br/>
As the lights go down<br/>
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly, whenever you smile<br/><br/>

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea<br/>
You touch me once and it's really something<br/>
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be<br/>
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world<br/>
But with you, I know it's no good<br/>
And I could wait patiently<br/>
But I really wish you would<br/><br/>

Drop everything now<br/>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br/>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br/>
Take away the pain<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly, whenever you smile<br/>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br/>
As the lights go down<br/>
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly, whenever you smile<br/><br/>

I run my fingers through your hair<br/>
And watch the lights go wild<br/>
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me<br/>
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right<br/>
And lead me up the staircase<br/>
Won't you whisper soft and slow<br/>
I'm captivated by you, baby<br/>
Like a fireworks show<br/><br/>

Drop everything now<br/>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br/>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br/>
Take away the pain<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br/>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br/>
As the lights go down<br/>
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br/>
'Cause I see sparks fly, whenever you smile<br/>
And the sparks fly, oh, baby, smile<br/>
And the sparks fly<br/>
